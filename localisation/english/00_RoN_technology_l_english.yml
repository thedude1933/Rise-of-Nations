tank_railgun_cannon:0 "Railgun Cannon"
tank_railgun_cannon_desc:0 "This specialized cannon fires shells via charged magnetic rails, instead of using explosive powder, bypassing the limits of chemical propellant. Extremely effective against even the thickest armor, but expensive and fragile to use.
tank_rolled_armor:0 "Rolled Armor"
tank_rolled_armor_desc:0 "Rolled armor uses rolled metals, which don't shatter like cast armor, which means they can better withstand hits from larger-caliber, heavier shells."
tank_carbon_armor:0 "Nano Carbon Armor"
tank_carbon_armor_desc:0 "A blessing of the Post-Modern Age of man, highly advanced Nano-Carbon Armor is made of Nano-Carbons. These special Carbon-based materials are denser, and far more resistant to stretching and bending than even the toughest alloys."
tank_composite_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
tank_composite_armor_desc:0 "Composite Screens are a special armor type which uses multiple materials, usually dense alloys and fibers to defeat Armor-Piercing shots."
reactive_armor:0 "Reactive Armor"
reactive_armor_desc:0 "Reactive Armor consists either of a lightweight series of plates of metal and elastic fibers, or bricks of explosive charges, to absorb missile impacts."
tank_spaced_armor:0 "Spaced Armor"
tank_spaced_armor_desc:0 "Spaced Armor is a method of weakening shaped charge shells, and explosive missiles, using a thin spaced plate to set off the shell before it hits the tank, weakening the impact on the tank."
rounded_armor:0 "Rounded Armor"
rounded_armor_desc:0 "Rounded Armor is simply armor with rounded edges. Rounded edges increases the chance a shell bounces off the edge of the armor plate, slightly increasing the tank's chance of surviving a hit."
tank_armor_1a:0 "Riveted Armor"
tank_armor_1a_desc:0 "Riveted Armor is an early method of mounting heavy armor plates to a vehicle. Thick armor requires faster, heavier, thinner shells to pierce, increasing the tanks chance of survival, at the cost of speed."
tank_armor_1b:0 "Upgraded Riveted Armor"
tank_armor_1b_desc:0 "By shaving down the rivets and bolts, we can lower the chance that a loose rivet will kill crew, if hit by an enemy's shell.
tank_armor_2a:0 "Great War Armor Research"
tank_armor_2a_desc:0 "If our tank crews are to have better odds of coming home from our next campaign, they need some protection while crossing the trenches of our foes."
tank_armor_2b:0 "Improved Great War Armor"
tank_armor_2b_desc:0 "Sloped frontal armor will better combat the basic howitzers mounted to the tanks of the 1910s, that were not intended to destroy tanks, but forts."
tank_armor_3b:0 "Advanced Armor research"
tank_armor_3b_desc:0 "Researching armor technologies has proved successful, but if we're to stay up to date with our enemies, we need to make our tanks lighter and more durable."
tank_armor_3a:0 "Welded Armor"
tank_armor_3a_desc:0 "Welded Armor, welded by a skilled worker, is much superior to riveted armor, and can be bent into shapes more suitable to the current reality of tank-on-tank combat."

#COUNTRY EVENTS

dnc_china.4.t:0 "Our Political Situation"
dnc_china.4.d:0 "Since our contact with the Western Powers and events like the Unequal Treaties, our 3 century-old empire has been in decline. Other events like the Taping Rebellion and more recently the Boxer Rebellion have seriously reduced our hold over the country and bled our coffers dry. The 1898 Coup by the Empress Dowager against the Emperor and liberal leaders of the Hundred Days Reform deposed the Guangxu Emperor and repealed the Hundred Days Reform, a reform set to make the Qing Empire into a constitutional monarchy. During this chaos, parties like the Revive China Society led by Republican Sun Yat Sen and small groups on Anarchists and Communists such as Chen Duxui have gained increasing support and have launched revolts in the path against the Qing government in the hopes of creating a republic. Because of this increasing decline, military leaders and local governers have started acting indpeendently, using their own private armies effectively dividing China between warlords."

This has exposed the corruption and regionalism of the empire to the public and has had a huge effect on morale"
dnc_china.7.a:0 "Our empire is crumbling..." 

dnc_china.6.t:0 "War with the Western Powers"
dnc_china.6.d:0 "After we decided to ally with the Boxers, war with the western powers was inevitable.

#LEADER INFO
CHI_HOS_TITLE:0 "Huángdì"
CHI_HOG_TITLE:0 "Huánghòu" 
CHI_GUANGXU_NAME:0 "Guangxu"
GUANGXU_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "10th Heavenly Emperor of the Great Qing and the de-jure leader of China, the Guangxu Emperor is the emperor of the greatest empire in Chinese history. Born in the Prince Chun Mansion in 1870 to the late Tongzhi Emperor, he was 4 years old when he ascended the throne and because he was a child monarch, exploitation and corruption was widespread. When he was 9, his mother died leaving Cixi as the new empress dowager and protector of the Guangxu Emperor. Even as he grew older, Cixi's influence on him grew with him, eventually giving lots of power to Cixi over government posititions. After the Qing's defeat against Japan in the Sino-Japanese War, Guangxu saw that a constitutional monarchy like that of Japan was the path the Qing needed to take if it was to become politically and economically stable. In 1898 he and members of the Reform China Society got together and passed liberal reforms named the Hundred Days Reform. Unhappy with this, Cixi couped the government and put Guangxu under house arrest where he lived as de-jure ruler of China. All of the reforms were pulled back and the reformist groups were exiled."
CIXI_LEADER_DESCRIPTION:0 "Born in 1835 to a duke of the Bordered Blue Banner, a banner of the Eight Banners of Manchuria in Peking, Cixi was destined to live a life in luxury in politics. She was well educated, and later an advisor to deceased emperor Xianfeng after becoming his 2nd wife in 1854. During her marriage to Xianfeng, she became well-informed about country affairs and made enemies and friends in the government. During the Opium Wars, the Xianfeng Emperor died of illness and disease and left the son of his first wife, Yi, as next emperor of the Great Qing. The Guangxu Emperor took power in 1875 and would become Cixi's adopted son in 1880. By this time, Cixi had an iron grip on the Chinese government and after the Guangxu Emperor's liberal reforms of the 1898 Hundred Days Reform she was unhappy with her loss of power and the Guangxu's reformist policy. This led to Cixi couping the emperor and taking power as de-facto ruler of the Great Qing and put the emperor under house arrest. Ever since she has taken full autocratic rule and has suppressed the Republican and Anarchist groups of China."

#BOOKMARKS

CHI_SILENT_NIGHT_DESC:0 "The Qing Dynasty has been in decline for over 6 decades since the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion, and growing resentment towards the Qing Emperor and the Manchu population have caused the political and economic stability of the empire to crumble. One of the leading figures against the Qing, Republican leader Sun Yat Sen has been getting support from many of China's inhabitants and the Republicans are set to overthrow the Qing. Can the Qing survive? Will China become a republic?"

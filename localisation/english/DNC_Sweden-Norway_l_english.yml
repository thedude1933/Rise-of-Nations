# EVENTS 
DNC_Sweden_Norway.1:0 "Norway Leaves the Union"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.1.d:0 "Today, the Norwegian government announced that it is no longer able to maintain the Union. It seems that they have been planning for independence for some time, and our plebiscite to reunite was rejected by both Norway and its citizens, and as such, both governments revoked the Act of Union. King Oscar renounced all claims on the Norwegian crown for himself and his successors as well, formally marking the end of the Swedish-Norwegian Union. Sweden may be able to take Norway by force, but it is unlikely as Norway's power has grown and the great powers seem favorable to Norwegian independence."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.1.a:0 "We must accept this and move forward."

DNC_Sweden_Norway.2:0 "The Economic Direction"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.2.d:0 "With the Union dissolved, Sweden must chart its own economic path. Debates rage within the Riksdag about the future direction of our economy. Should we focus on industrialization, or maintain our traditional agricultural base? The choices we make now will shape the future of our nation for decades to come."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.2.a:0 "Focus on industrialization."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.2.b:0 "Maintain our agricultural base."

DNC_Sweden_Norway.3:0 "Union in Crisis"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.3.d:0 "The situation within the Union has reached a critical point. Norwegian diplomats have left the negotiating table and refuse to participate in the election of a new Prime Minister. Despite this, the Union remains intact, but it is under severe strain. The lack of cooperation from the Norwegian side has created a political deadlock, and the future of the Union hangs in the balance. We must decide how to proceed in this delicate situation."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.3.a:0 "Prepare for potential unrest."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.3.b:0 "Only the king can fix this!"

DNC_Sweden_Norway.4:0 "Protests in Norway"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.4.d:0 "Despite the agreement to preserve the Union, widespread protests have erupted across Norway. Many Norwegians feel that their desires for independence have been ignored, and they are demanding greater autonomy or even outright separation. The streets of Oslo are filled with demonstrators, and the situation is becoming increasingly volatile."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.4.a:0 "Offer concessions to the protesters."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.4.b:0 "Suppress the protests."

DNC_Sweden_Norway.5:0 "Boström's Ascendancy"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.5.d:0 "In the wake of the Union crisis, Erik Gustaf Boström has emerged as a strong leader within Sweden. Appointed as Prime Minister, Boström promises to bring stability and prosperity to the Union. He faces the immense challenge of addressing the grievances of both Swedes and Norwegians while steering the Kingdom through a period of significant upheaval."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.5.a:0 "Support Boström's leadership."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.5.b:0 "Seek an alternative leader."

DNC_Sweden_Norway.6:0 "Boström's Reforms"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.6.d:0 "Prime Minister Boström has announced a series of reforms aimed at placating the Norwegian population and strengthening the Union. These include greater political representation for Norwegians, economic investments in Norwegian infrastructure, and policies promoting cultural integration. While some view these reforms as steps towards a more harmonious Union, others fear they may not go far enough to address underlying issues."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.6.a:0 "Implement the reforms."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.6.b:0 "Reject the reforms and maintain the status quo."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.6.c:0 "Propose alternative reforms."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.7:0 "Choosing the Futur Statens Plan or Boström's Plan"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.7.d:0 "With the Union's stability hanging in the balance, the government is faced with a crucial decision. Two distinct plans have been proposed to address the ongoing issues and chart the future of the Kingdom. Statens Plan, a state-driven initiative focused on centralization and state control, aims to unify the administration and strengthen central authority. On the other hand, Boström's Plan emphasizes decentralization, local governance, and greater autonomy for Norway within the Union. The choice made now will define the direction of the Kingdom and the fate of the Union."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.8:0 "Formation of the Boström Government"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.8.d:0 "Following a period of intense political negotiation and public unrest, Erik Gustaf Boström has successfully formed a new government. As Prime Minister, Boström aims to bring stability and progress to the Kingdom of Sweden and Norway. His administration promises to address the pressing issues of the day, including the ongoing tensions within the Union and the need for economic and social reforms. The path ahead is challenging, but Boström's leadership offers hope for a more unified and prosperous future."

DNC_Sweden_Norway.9:0 "Boström Ousted, Otter Emerges"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.9.d:0 "The political tensions within the Union have culminated in a dramatic shift of power. Prime Minister Erik Gustaf Boström has been ousted following widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of the crisis. In his place, Johan Otto, a charismatic and determined leader, has emerged to take the helm. Otter promises a fresh approach and new strategies to address the Union's challenges, aiming to restore stability and unity."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.9.a:0 "Welcome otter!"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.10:0 "Otter Resigns, Boström Forms Second Cabinet"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.10.d:0 "Facing mounting pressure and internal strife, Johan Otto has announced his resignation as Prime Minister. The Union is once again in a state of flux as Otto steps down, citing the need for new leadership to guide the Kingdom through its challenges. In a surprising turn of events, Erik Gustaf Boström has been able to gather support and form a second cabinet, promising stability and a return to his previous policies. The Kingdom watches closely as Boström takes up the reins once more."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.10.a:0 "Support Boström's return to power."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.10.b:0 "Call for new leadership."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.11:0 "Dissolution of the Union"
DNC_Sweden_Norway.11.d:0 "After years of political turmoil and strained relations, the Swedish-Norwegian Union has finally come to an end. Following a series of negotiations and plebiscites, both nations have agreed to peacefully dissolve the Union. This marks the end of a long-standing political entity that has shaped the history of both Sweden and Norway. The future now holds new challenges and opportunities for both nations as they embark on separate paths."
DNC_Sweden_Norway.12.a:0 "The Union is now dissolved."

 russia_civilwar.1.d:0 "The All-Russian Constituent Assembly, elected for its first and sole time in November 25th, 1917, was the first attempt of a opening of Russia to democracy, where the Social-Revolutionaries, led by Viktor Chernov, won the majority of seats, followed by the Bolsheviks, under Lenin. That was until the latter, in control of the capital and the Western Russia since the October Revolution, distinguishing themselves of the so-called 'Bourgeois Democracy', dissolved the Parliamentary body, and banned the parties affiliated, such as the Right SRs, Mensheviks, Kadets, among others. This radical decision promoted political unrest on behalf of other Party high members and leaders, who plublicly criticized harshly the communists posture, as a tyrannic measure and being 'against the people's will'."
